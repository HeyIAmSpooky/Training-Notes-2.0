## Whois Enumeration
WHOIS is a public database that houses information collected when someone registers a domain name. It is used to identify the nameservers of a particular domain.

## DNS Recon
Identify the records related to the domain of the target (dnsdumpster.com)

## Subdomain Enumeration with Sublist3r

## DNS Zone Transfers
DNS zone transfer (query type AXFR) is a type of DNS transaction and one of the mechanisms available for administrators to replicate DNS databases across a set of DNS servers. A zone transfer uses TCP for transport, in the form of a client-server transaction.
