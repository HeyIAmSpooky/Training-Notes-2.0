## Metasploit Framework CLI
The **Metasploit Framework Command Line Interface (MSFcli)** is a command line utility used to facilitate the creation of automation scripts that utilize Metasploit modules. It can redirect output from other tools into msfcli and vice versa.

## Migrated from Unsorted Notes — MSF Modules

### MSF Modules
- **Exploit** — Takes advantage of a vulnerability, typically paired with a payload.
- **Payload** — Code delivered by MSF and remotely executed on the target after successful exploitation (e.g., a reverse shell initiating a connection from the target back to the attacker).
- **Encoder** — Used to encode payloads to avoid AV detection (e.g., `shikata_ga_nai` for Windows payloads).
- **NOPS** — Ensures payload sizes are consistent and stable when executed.
- **Auxiliary** — Performs additional functionality like port scanning and enumeration.

## Migrated from Unsorted Notes — Meterpreter Payload

### Meterpreter Payload
The Meterpreter (Meta-Interpreter) payload is an advanced multi-functional payload executed in memory on the target system, making it difficult to detect. It communicates over a stager socket and provides an interactive command interpreter that facilitates system command execution, file system navigation, keylogging, and more.

## Migrated from Unsorted Notes — Penetration Testing with MSF

### Penetration Testing with MSF

MSF can be used to perform and automate various tasks under the penetration testing life cycle. We can adopt PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard) as a roadmap:

```
Penetration Testing Phases
    │
    ├─ Information Gathering
    ├─ Enumeration
    ├─ Exploitation
    └─ Post Exploitation
         ├─ Privilege Escalation
         ├─ Maintaining Persistent Access
         └─ Clearing Tracks
```
